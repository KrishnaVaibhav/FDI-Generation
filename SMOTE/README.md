The script reads a CSV file named "merged_file.csv" into a DataFrame called [`data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition"). It then converts the 'marker' column to numeric values, coercing any errors to `NaN`. The 'marker' column is further processed to create a binary classification: values between 7 and 12 (inclusive) are set to 1, and all other values are set to 0.

Next, the script separates the features ([`X`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition")) from the target variable ([`y`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition")). It handles any infinite values in [`X`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition") by replacing them with `NaN` and then fills these `NaN` values with the maximum value found in the DataFrame. This ensures that the dataset does not contain any missing or infinite values, which could cause issues during model training.

To address class imbalance, the script first applies [`RandomOverSampler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A42%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition") to oversample the minority class in [`y`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition"). This creates a more balanced dataset by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class. The script then applies [`SMOTE`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A35%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition") (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, further balancing the dataset.

The resampled features ([`X_resampled`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition")) and target variable ([`y_resampled`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition")) are concatenated into a single DataFrame called [`resampled_data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A23%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition"). The script identifies rows where the 'marker' is 1 (indicating the minority class) and creates a subset called [`fdi_data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition"). This subset is then appended back to [`resampled_data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A23%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition"), effectively doubling the minority class samples.

Finally, the script saves the [`fdi_data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDU%2FSem%20-%20%24%2FData%2Ffiles%2FRMT_data_gen.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2210e1c4d4-7623-4cf2-920f-ee5a0e9450e8%22%5D "Go to definition") subset to a CSV file named "synthetic_fdi_data2.csv". This file contains the synthetic samples generated for the minority class, which can be used for further analysis or model training.
